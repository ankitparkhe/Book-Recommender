In this project, I developed a data-driven book recommender system by performing end-to-end data analysis on a dataset of over 11,000 books. 
I began with data cleaning removing redundant columns (bookID, isbn, isbn13), standardizing column names, and extracting key features like publication year for deeper analysis
Using exploratory data analysis (EDA)
1) Top authors by book count (visualized via Seaborn bar plots)
2) Language distribution (English being the most common)
3) Publication trends over time
4) Correlations between ratings, reviews, and other features
5) 
Finally, I prepared the dataset for recommendation algorithms by analyzing ratings, reviews, and metadata to enable content-based or collaborative filtering approaches

This project demonstrates my expertise in data wrangling, visualization, and recommender systemsâ€”skills essential
for data-driven decision-making in e-commerce, publishing, or digital libraries.
